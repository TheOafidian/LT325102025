#### Hello World
I used Eleventy to create this website because I find it the easiest Static Site Generator (SSG) to understand, especially with its support for using `*.html` for layout. I chose DaisyUI as the CSS framework because its simple tutorials matched my level as a beginner. 
The source code of this starter is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sira313/twcarty).
>I apologize for any shortcomings as I am not a coder by background.
