#### HELLO FRIEND

Hello friend? That's lame. Maybe i should give you a name. But that's slippery slope. You're only in my head. We have to remember that.

#### TRUTH

The truth is... I'm the one to blame. I'm the problem. This was my fault. All of it. I did this. Fuck me.

#### MASK

How do I take off a mask when it stops being a mask? When it's as much a part of me as me?
