#### HELLO FRIEND

Hello friend? That's lame. Maybe i should give you a name. But that's slippery slope. You're only in my head. We have to remember that.

#### QUESTION

It's one thing to question your mind. It's another to question your eyes and ears. But then again, isn't it all the same? Our senses just mediocre inputs for our brain? Sure, we rely on them, trust they accurately portray the real world around us. But what if the haunting truth is they can't? That what we perceive isn't the real world at all, but just our mind's best guess? That all we really have is a garbled reality, a fuzzy picture we will never truly make out?

>See me, Elliot Alderson
