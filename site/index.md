#### HELLO FRIEND

Hello friend? That's lame. Maybe i should give you a name. But that's slippery slope. You're only in my head. We have to remember that.

#### TRUTH

The truth is... I'm the one to blame. I'm the problem. This was my fault. All of it. I did this. Fuck me.

#### MASK

How do I take off a mask when it stops being a mask? When it's as much a part of me as me?

#### QUESTION

It's one thing to question your mind. It's another to question your eyes and ears. But then again, isn't it all the same? Our senses just mediocre inputs for our brain? Sure, we rely on them, trust they accurately portray the real world around us. But what if the haunting truth is they can't? That what we perceive isn't the real world at all, but just our mind's best guess? That all we really have is a garbled reality, a fuzzy picture we will never truly make out?
